# PostgreSQL plugin
Provides native Zabbix solution for monitoring PostgreSQL (object-relational database system). 
It can monitor several PostgreSQL instances simultaneously, remote or local to the Zabbix Agent.
The plugin keeps connections in the open state to reduce network congestion, latency, CPU and 
memory usage. Best for use in conjunction with the official 
[PostgreSQL template.](https://git.zabbix.com/projects/ZBX/repos/zabbix/browse/templates/db/postgresql_agent2) 
You can extend it or create your template for your specific needs.

## Requirements
- Zabbix Agent 2
- Go >= 1.13 (required only to build from source)

## Supported versions
PostgreSQL, version 10, 11, 12

## Installation
The plugin is supplied as part of the Zabbix Agent 2 and does not require any special installation steps. 
Once Zabbix Agent 2 is installed, the plugin is ready to work. You only need to make sure a PostgreSQL instance is 
available for connection, and you have necessary access rights.

## Configuration
The Zabbix Agent's configuration file is used to configure plugins.

**Plugins.Postgres.CallTimeout** — The maximum time in seconds for waiting when a request has to be done.  
*Default value:* equals the global Timeout configuration parameter.  
*Limits:* 1-30

**Plugins.Postgres.Timeout** — The maximum time in seconds for waiting when a connection has to be established.  
*Default value:* equals the global Timeout configuration parameter.  
*Limits:* 1-30

**Plugins.Postgres.CustomQueriesPath** — Full pathname of a directory containing *.sql* files with custom queries.  
*Default value:* — (the feature is disabled by default)

**Plugins.Postgres.KeepAlive** — Sets a time for waiting before unused connections will be closed.  
*Default value:* 300 sec.  
*Limits:* 60-900

### Configuring connection
A connection can be configured using either keys' parameters or named sessions.     

*Notes*:  
* It is not possible to mix configuration using named sessions and keys' parameters simultaneously.
* You can leave any connection parameter empty, a default hard-coded value will be used in the such case.
* Embedded URI credentials (userinfo) are forbidden and will be ignored. So, you can't pass the credentials by this:   
  
      pgsql.ping[tcp://user:password@127.0.0.1/postgres] — WRONG  
  
  The correct way is:
    
      pgsql.ping[tcp://127.0.0.1,user,password,postgres]
      
* The only supported network schema for a URI are "tcp" and "unix".  
Examples of valid URIs:
    - tcp://127.0.0.1:5432
    - tcp://localhost
    - localhost
    - unix:/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432 (**Note:** a full socket file path expected, not a socket directory)
    - /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432
      
#### Using keys' parameters
The common parameters for all keys are: [ConnString][,User][,Password][,Database] 
Where ConnString can be either a URI or a session name.   
ConnString will be treated as a URI if no session with the given name is found.  
If you use ConnString as a session name, just skip the rest of the connection parameters.  
 
#### Using named sessions
Named sessions allow you to define specific parameters for each PostgreSQL instance. Currently, there are only four
supported parameters: Uri, User, Password and Service.
It's a bit more secure way to store credentials compared to item keys or macros.  

E.g: suppose you have two PostgreSQL instances: "Prod" and "Test". 
You should add the following options to the agent configuration file:   
       
    Plugins.Postgres.Sessions.Prod.Uri=tcp://192.168.1.1:5432
    Plugins.Postgres.Sessions.Prod.User=<UserForProd>
    Plugins.Postgres.Sessions.Prod.Password=<PasswordForProd>
    Plugins.Postgres.Sessions.Prod.Database=proddb
    
    Plugins.Postgres.Sessions.Test.Uri=tcp://192.168.0.1:5432
    Plugins.Postgres.Sessions.Test.User=<UserForTest>
    Plugins.Postgres.Sessions.Test.Password=<PasswordForTest>
    Plugins.Postgres.Sessions.Test.Service=testdb
        
Then you will be able to use these names as the 1st parameter (ConnString) in keys instead of URIs, e.g:

    pgsql.ping[Prod]
    pgsql.ping[Test]

*Note*: sessions names are case-sensitive, the first letter of a name must be upper-cased.

## Supported keys
**pgsql.archive[\<commonParams\>]** — returns info about archive files.  
*Returns:* Result of the
```sql
SELECT row_to_json(T)
FROM (SELECT archived_count, failed_count from pg_stat_archiver) T

sum(CASE WHEN wait_event IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS waiting,
(SELECT count(*) FROM pg_prepared_xacts) AS prepared

## Custom queries
It's possible to extend functionality of the plugin using user-defined queries. To do that you should place all your
queries in a directory specified in Plugins.Postgres.CustomQueriesPath (there is no default path) as *.sql files.
For example, you have a tree:

    /etc/zabbix/postgres/sql/  
    ├── long_tx.sql
    ├── payment.sql    
    └── top_proc.sql
     
You should set Plugins.Postgres.CustomQueriesPath=/etc/zabbix/postgres/sql     
     
So, when the queries are in place, you can execute them:
  
    pgsql.custom.query[<commonParams>,top_proc]  
    pgsql.custom.query[<commonParams>,long_tx,600]
          
You can pass as many parameters to a query as you need.   
The syntax for placeholder parameters uses "$#", where "#" is an index number of a parameter.   
E.g: 
```
/* payment.sql */

SELECT 
    amount 
FROM 
    payment 
WHERE
    user = $1
    AND service_id = $2
    AND date = $3
``` 

    pgsql.custom.query[<commonParams>,payment,"John Doe",1,"10/25/2020"]

## Troubleshooting
The plugin uses Zabbix agent's logs. You can increase debugging level of Zabbix Agent if you need more details about 
what is happening.
