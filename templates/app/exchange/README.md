# Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 by Zabbix agent

## Overview

For Zabbix version: 5.0 and higher  
Official Template for Microsoft Exchange Server 2016.


This template was tested on:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 2016 CU18
- Zabbix, version 5.0

## Setup

> See [Zabbix template operation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/5.0/manual/config/templates_out_of_the_box/zabbix_agent) for basic instructions.

Metrics are collected by Zabbix agent.

1\. Import the template into Zabbix.

2\. Link the imported template to a host with MS Exchange.

Note that template doesn't provide information about Windows services state. Recommended to use it with "OS Windows by Zabbix agent" template.


## Zabbix configuration

No specific Zabbix configuration is required.
