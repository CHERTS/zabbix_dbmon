# Zookeeper by HTTP

## Overview

For Zabbix version: 5.0 and higher  
The template to monitor Apache Zookeeper by Zabbix that work without any external scripts.
Most of the metrics are collected in one go, thanks to Zabbix bulk data collection.



This template was tested on:

- Apache Zookeeper, version 3.6+

## Setup

> See [Zabbix template operation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/5.0/manual/config/templates_out_of_the_box/http) for basic instructions.

This template works with standalone and cluster instances. Metrics are collected from each Zookeper node by requests to [AdminServer](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_adminserver).  
By default AdminServer is enabled and listens on port 8080.  
You can enable or configure AdminServer parameters according [official documentations](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_adminserver_config).  
Don't forget to change macros {$ZOOKEEPER.COMMAND_URL}, {$ZOOKEEPER.PORT}, {$ZOOKEEPER.SCHEME}.


## Zabbix configuration

No specific Zabbix configuration is required.

### Macros used

|Name|Description|Default|
|----|-----------|-------|
|{$ZOOKEEPER.COMMAND_URL} |<p>The URL for listing and issuing commands relative to the root URL (admin.commandURL).</p> |`commands` |
|{$ZOOKEEPER.FILE_DESCRIPTORS.MAX.WARN} |<p>Maximum percentage of file descriptors usage alert threshold (for trigger expression).</p> |`85` |
|{$ZOOKEEPER.OUTSTANDING_REQ.MAX.WARN} |<p>Maximum number of outstanding requests (for trigger expression).</p> |`10` |
|{$ZOOKEEPER.PENDING_SYNCS.MAX.WARN} |<p>Maximum number of pending syncs from the followers (for trigger expression).</p> |`10` |
|{$ZOOKEEPER.PORT} |<p>The port the embedded Jetty server listens on (admin.serverPort).</p> |`8080` |
|{$ZOOKEEPER.SCHEME} |<p>Request scheme which may be http or https</p> |`http` |
